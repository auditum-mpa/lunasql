## Description

AAnother naive but positive and fun Java JDBC SQL shell client. Designed to simply query databases by JDBC, or automate database tasks and prototype applications before real implementation.

This is an old personal project that I used to develop occasionally, and that I just put on GitHub under an opensource license, but the development started in 2009! So please bear with me as to the quality of the code. It works, and it can be useful!

## Features

  * connects to any database by JDBC driver,
  * sends SQL commands to database server,
  * adds predefined useful commands and macros,
  * is highly configurable by command line or file,
  * accepts user-defined macros and command plugins,
  * evaluates expressions by JSR-223,
  * embeds a minimalistic graphical IDE,
  * includes an HTTP server for remote querying,
  * secures scripts execution by digital signature,
  * provides useful javascript scripting libraries,
  * sources recently released on GitHub,
  * only one (small) jar file!

Enjoy!
